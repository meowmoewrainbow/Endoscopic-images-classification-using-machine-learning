# Endoscopic-images-classification-using-machine-learning
A simple project using basic computer vision with K-nearest neighbors algorithm and Histogram of Oriented Gradient descriptor.
## Dataset
[Kvasir dataset](https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir/): An open gastrointestinal dataset which contains 8 classes.

I only used 6 classes to make the project more simple.

## Library
